## Nice-to-Haves

- User Account Management: Customizable registration and profiles for different user types. This relies on implementing an authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication will enable a more personalized experience and is essential for features like booking management and receiving personalized notifications.

- Dynamic Weather Information: Integration of real-time weather updates for informed lesson planning. This feature could be enhanced with authentication by allowing users to receive weather alerts for their booked lessons directly.

- Instructor and School Portals: Dedicated sections for managing schedules, lessons, and student progress. Authentication is crucial for these portals to ensure that only authorized instructors and school administrators can access sensitive information and functionalities.

- Notifications and Alerts: Personalized reminders and alerts for users about their lessons, weather changes, or other important updates. With authentication, these notifications can be tailored to each user's schedule and preferences.

- Feedback and Rating System: For mutual reviews between students and instructors/schools. Authentication will help in verifying the identity of reviewers and ensuring that feedback is genuine and reliable.

- Interactive Maps: Displaying locations of schools and popular kitesurfing spots. While useful for all users, authentication could allow for customized map views based on the user's location and preferences.

- Admin Dashboard: For analytics and management. Authentication will enable secure access to this dashboard, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view and analyze sensitive platform data.

- Payment Gateway Integration: For processing lesson payments securely. Authentication plays a key role in payment transactions to protect user information and facilitate smooth transactions.

- FAQs and Support Section: Possibly with AI-driven customer support. Authentication could enhance this feature by allowing for personalized support experiences based on user history and preferences.

- Authentication: Implementing a secure and efficient authentication system to support the above features. This will include registration, login, password management, and possibly social media integrations for ease of access. Focusing on authentication later allows for the development of core features first, ensuring that the platform can operate effectively even before personalized user experiences are introduced.
